Some Simple Scripts</A>
</H2>
<PRE>
#!/bin/bash
export MY_NAME=frodo
echo Hello from $MY_NAME
</PRE>
While this script doesn't do very much we can see some of the basics.  One way
of thinking about shell scripts is that they exist to automate the running
of Linux commands.  To do that we need some of the usual programming 
constructions, setting variables, looping, if then else clauses, and I/O.  
While all of these things exist in shell scripts, they are somewhat more
rudimetary than in other languages, and the syntax may seem unusual.  Just 
remember that the lines in the shell script run just as if you had typed them
into the shell manually.  

<P>
The first line of the script invokes the shell that the script will use in 
this case bash.  This should always be the first line of your scripts.
then we set a variable just as if we were setting an environment variable
in our shell.  In this case we use the syntax <I>export name=value</I>, which
not only assigns the value to the variable, but also makes it available for
other programs that may be run from within this script.  The next line just 
executes that echo command with the new variable and some other text.

<P>
Variables in shell scripts are not typed.  That means that you can assign any
type of value to the variable at any time.  If you reference a variable that
has not been initialized, you get the null string.  That's all, the shell gives
no warings or errors.  Note that just because variables are not typed doesn't
mean that you can add a number to an integer. You have to be careful to use 
assigned variables correctly.  

<P>
Now that we know how to get output from a shell script, but lets take a look 
at how to get input.  To do this we use the read command, as in the script 
below.  This example also illustrates some intracacies of working
with variables. The <code>#</code> character is the comment caracter in shell scripts.

<P>
<PRE>
#!/bin/bash
export MY_NAME=frodo
echo Please tell me your name:
read USERNAME
echo Hello $USERNAME my name is $MY_NAME
#The next line split for space reasons
echo I will create you a file. Please tell me the 
		 name of your file 
read FILENAME
touch ${FILENAME}_1
</PRE>

<P>
In this script we read the name of the user in with the command read.  Once
we get the name of the file from the user we use the touch command to create
a file <I>name_1</I>.  But notice the difference in how the variable is 
handled in the touch command line.  The { and } are used to deliniate the
variable name from the rest of the line.  If we don't do this the script ends
with an error.
