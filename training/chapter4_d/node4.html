Bash Configuration files
</H2>
Most modifications of the environment may be accomplished through the use of 
two bash configuration files <I>.bash_profile</I> and <I>.bashrc</I>.(Note the
periods at the beginning.) .bash_profile is a  personal profile that is 
processed every time you login, and .bashrc is a setup file that is processed 
when you open a non-login shell. In practice most setups have .bash_profile 
call .bashrc when openning a login shell. 

<P>
Traditionally, the configuration files are used to set up a users environment 
so that it is the same each time they start a shell.  Remember that a shell is
in someways nothing more than the interface to the OS.  They can also be used
to display system information, or run scripts everytime the shell starts. 

<P>
As we noted before an alias is just a key short cut for an command that is 
long or often repeated.  It can also make your environment more user freindly. 
For example, the <I>cp</I> command will by default copy over a file without 
a warning.  There is a flag for the cp command <I>cp -i</I> that will cause
the shell to prompt before overwriting a file.  For most people this is a 
good idea, and we can put it in the .bashrc file the line to do this is 
simply, <BR><I>alias cp='cp-i'</I>. 

<P>
Much of the control that you can gain over the enviroment involves setting 
<I>environment variables</I>.  These variables are often refered to by programs
and the OS.  For example, we use the program PBS for queuing jobs
on our systems.  This program needs to know where its configuration files are
so to use it easily you must set the enviroment variable PBS to be the location
of these files.  One of the most important environment variables is PATH.
This is the list of directories that the OS searches when a command is
typed in.  It usually contains the standard system binary directories, for
example /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin, but may be modified by each user to point
to directories that they wish to use.  It also sets the order that these
directories are searched.  Suppose that I want to add the directory
/usr/lib/mpich/bin (where the MPI commands are found) to my path.  In 
.bash_profile  I can include either of the following sets of lines.
<PRE>
PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/mpich/bin
export PATH

or

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/mpich/bin
</PRE>

<P>
Another common varable to set determines the prompt.  To change the prompt in
the bash shell you you use the command: PS1="value" which can be most strings,
plus the following codes that are often useful.

<UL>
<LI><code>\d</code> - the date (day-of-the-week month day)
</LI>
<LI><code>\h</code> - the hostname (without the domain)
</LI>
<LI><code>\n</code> - start a new line
</LI>
<LI><code>\u</code> - the current username
</LI>
<LI><code>\w</code> - the working directory 
</LI>
</UL><HR>
