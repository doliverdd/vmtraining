Exercises

<OL>
<LI>Change your prompt to be the date, working directory, and user name 
followed by a $. Now add these changes to your .bash_profile to make them
permanant.
</LI>
<LI>Find out all of the aliases that are set in your shell.  Read the man
page on alias to find out how. 
</LI>
<LI>Some interesting bash functions.  If you have run at least a few
commands from your shell, try hitting the up and down arrows on the keyboard.
What is happening?  Now try to type the first couple of characters in 
the name of a file in your directory and then hit the tab key.  
</LI>
<LI>If you are used to DOS, you may have used the rename,del, and dir 
commands.  Set up aliases in your .bashrc file so that typing these
commands results in the appropriate actions.
</LI>
<LI>What is the current value of your PATH variable? Create a directory
bin in your home directory.  Now add this directory to your PATH in 
.bash_profile.  Check your PATH variable again. Is the new directory there?
If not try using the command source to enable the changes that you made to 
.bash_profile.  Where in the PATH is your new directory? Can you put it at 
the end of the path? At the beginning?
</LI>
<LI>Try the who command. What does it show? Now suppose that you want to know
if root is logged on to the system.  Use the who, <code>|</code>, and grep commands
to only list occurances of root being logged on.
</LI>
<LI>Advanced Exercise - Now suppose that you are a system administrator 
with a system that is acting unusual.  You want a quick command that will log 
to the file logon.log the time and date, and who was logged on.  Use the touch
command to create the logon.log file.  If you want to run two commands at one
time in bash you can put a ; between them.  Run the date command followed by
the who command and redirect the output to the logon.log file.  In bash you
can rerun an earlier command by using the up and down arrows.  Try this to 
rerun the date/who command.  Run the cat command on the logon.log file.  Are
both listings there? Do you need to change the command so that you keep all of
the entries in the log file?
</LI>
<LI>Advanced Exercise - Compile and run the program HelloWorldError in
the code directory.  Now try running the program with the command
<PRE>
HelloWorldError &gt; output
</PRE>
Can you explain what happens? Read the man page on bash and find out how to 
redirect both standard out and standard error to a file, and then try it with
this program.
