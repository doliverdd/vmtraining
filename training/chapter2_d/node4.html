File System Security</A>
</H2>

<P>
On most Linux systems users have a private directory which is usually 
"<code>/HOMEDIRECTORYPATH/username</code>". A <I>path</I> <A NAME="32"></A> is the 
series of directories that indicate the location of a file.  For our purposes
we will assume that "HOMEDIRECTORYPATH" is just the directory <BR><code>/home/username</code>.
(On some systems this may be more complicated, for instance the default on 
Solaris is <BR><code>/exports/home/username</code>.)Linux allows users to set 
the security options of every file.  When we do
a listing of <code>/home/frodo</code>, we get the following output.
<PRE>
[frodo@macros frodo]$ ls -lR
.:
total 12
drwxrwxr-x    2 frodo    users  ... bcCode
-rw-r--r--    1 frodo    users  ... bcCode.tar.gz
                                                                                
./bcCode:
total 16
-rw-r--r--    1 frodo    users  ... hello
-rw-rw-r--    1 frodo    users  ... hello.c
[frodo@macros frodo]$
</PRE>
<A NAME="35"></A>
A few of the fields of this listing have been removed in the interest of 
conserving space. Let's take a look at some of the parts of this listing.
The term <BR>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
"<code>[frodo@macros frodo]$</code>" <BR>

</DIV>
is the prompt.  This string is formated
in the shell's configuration files.(see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#subsection:bcf"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="file:/usr/share/latex2html/icons/crossref.png"></A>) Here, "frodo" 
refers to the account name, and "macros" is the name of the server.  The string
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
"<code>ls -lR</code>" <BR>

</DIV>
is a call to the command "ls", which is the command for listing files and/or
directories. The "-lR" are the options.  This command/option structure is 
standard for Linux.  We will see more about this when we discuss the "man"
or help command. In this case the "l" in "-lR" means give the "long" or 
detailed listing, and the "R" makes the listing recursive so that it will list
files in the subdirectories.  We will be exploring other options to the ls 
command in Exercises <A HREF="node6.html#subsection:Ex1">2.2.3</A>.
The first group of files are those directly in Frodo's home
directory.  You will notice that the line for bcCode starts with a d.  This
indicates that this file is a directory.  After the d you see the characters
rwxrwxr-x these characters are the permissions field.  The permissions come
in three groups of three letters.  The groups are owner, group, and world.  
The possible letters are r, w and x which stand for read permissions, write
permissions, and execute permissions respectively.  According to this output
the owner Frodo and the group users, can read, write and execute this directory.So you may be wondering why a directory needs execution permission.  The 
answer is that giving a user or group execute permissions on a directory means
that they can <I>cd</I> or move into that directory. The last three characters on 
this line r-x means that the world (another way of saying all users) have read
and execute permissions on this directory, but they cannot write to it.  This
means that any user can <I>cd</I> to this directory and list the files, but they
cannot create or delete files.

<P>
The file permissions are changed with the <I>chmod</I> <A NAME="45"></A> command.
You can use the letters u,g,o,a for users, group, others, or all and the letters
w,r,x for read write and execute.  A + adds permissions and a - subtracts 
permissions.  For example if Frodo wanted to let all users have write
permissions on his directory bcCode&nbsp;(a very bad idea), he would give the command:

<P>
<code>chmod o+w bcCode</code>

<P>
The corresponding line in the above listing would become:

<P>
<code> drwxrwxrwx    2 frodo    users  ... bcCode</code>
