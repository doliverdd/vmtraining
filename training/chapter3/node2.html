The VI Editor</A>
</H1>
The vi editor has been included with the *nix systems for quite some time.  Part
of it's longevity is because it is the lowest common denominator.  When you 
login to any *nix system it will be there.  Although it's interface may not
be the best, many people find that after they become comfortable with vi that
all other editors are somewhat slow.  Since there is not a lot of theory to
using a cluster most of this section will be devoted to leading you through
exercises working with vi.  

<P>
There is one aspect of vi that you should be aware of before you start working
the examples.  Vi is mode based. That is when working with vi you are in one
mode or the other, and which mode your in will determine the effect of what
you type.  We will refer to these modes as <I>cursor movement, input, and 
command modes</I>.
Vi starts in cursor movement mode. In this mode you can move back and forth 
in the text, and do searches both forward and backward. Input mode is just
what it implies, this is the mode for entering text.  Command mode is 
for entering editor commands for example when you want to save the file.

<P>
There are several different flavors of vi available.  The one that you will be
using is called vim, or improved vi.  We are introducing you to this version 
because it does syntax highlighting.  That is it will color different parts of
programming files based on the syntax of that language.
