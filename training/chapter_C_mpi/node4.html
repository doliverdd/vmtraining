A note on output</A>
</H2>
Getting output from an MPI program is not as straightforward as it is in
serial programming.  This is a topic of much discussion, and research.  In
general if you put a print statement into an MPI program, it will not 
necessarily print in some convenient fashion.  Remember that each node 
operates independently. Suppose that an MPI program has the following code,
and that the float value in the second printf is equal to the rank of the
process.
<PRE>
printf("my rank is %d\n",local_rank);   
...
processing code
...
printf("my value is %3.1f\n",val);
</PRE>
The output from this bit of code could be in any order.
<PRE>
my rank is 0
my rank is 1
my rank is 2
my value is 0.0 
my value is 1.0
my value is 2.0

or

my rank is 0
my value is 0.0
my rank is 2
my rank is 1
my value is 1.0
my value is 2.0
</PRE>
The only thing that you can be sure of is that the program will run sequentially
on each processor.  There are advanced methods of I/O for MPI, and there are
some parallel I/O calls that you may want to explore as you become more
familiar with MPI.  For now you should do one of two things.  If you want to 
have nice tidy output, send messages to the root process and print from
there, or make sure that each line of output includes the rank of the process
so that you can be sure of which process is doing the output.
