Beowulf Cluster
</H2>
Traditionally High Performance computing was only done on large proprietary 
systems. These systems (also known as Big Iron, or super computers)<A NAME="8"></A> were expensive,
highly specialized computers that were capable of very fast computations.  They
had several problems.  The programming languages and libraries were not usually
portable, which meant that it was quite expensive to switch between vendors. 
Each machine required personnel trained specifically for that machine,
which added to the expense of switching computer companies.  Also when the speed of these machines was no longer fast, they had to be replaced again at great
expense.  

<P>
Beowulf Cluster Computing uses commodity off the shelf hardware (COTS)
<A NAME="9"></A> to achieve speeds near those of the Big Iron machines at a much
lower cost.  To achieve this, standard desktop quality computers are connected
together over a network.  These computers then work in parallel to do 
computations much faster than could be accomplished individually. These 
cluster computers generally use special libraries to handle communications.  
The systems that you will be working on will use the MPICH libraries. 
Not all computations work well on a cluster computer.  To understand which 
problems lend themselves to the cluster environment we need to take a look at
a property of computer programs called granularity.<A NAME="10"></A>  
Simply stated, granularity is the ratio between the amount of 
communications and the amount of computation
necessary to solve a problem. When this ratio is low, or when there is not
too much communication, the problem is coarse grained.  If there is a lot of
communication relative to the amount of computation the program is called fine
grained.  The cluster environment is best for medium and coarse grained 
applications. Granularity thus helps us define how effectively 
a program can be subdivided for parallel execution. Coarse grained programs are often referred to as "embarrassingly 
parallel". <A NAME="11"></A>

<P>
The Research Computing Core at USF has a 48 node Beowulf Cluster available for
students and faculty.  During this seminar you will be coding and running
an example program on this cluster.
