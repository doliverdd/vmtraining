Operating Systems</A>
</H2>
Most of the systems that are used for HPC at USF run a variation of a Unix
operating system. <A NAME="21"></A> The Linux operating system is the standard for cluster 
computing.  There are several reasons for this.  This variant of Unix is free
and open source.  The cost of proprietary operating systems can greatly increase
the cost of a cluster, which makes Linux more attractive.  Perhaps more 
importantly, the code for the OS is available. This means that researchers can
modify the system. At the current time there is relatively inexpensive 64 bit 
software available for use in clusters.  Linux has one of the best kernels for
this hardware. Some of our systems also run the Solaris operating system.  This
is the Unix variant used on the Sun Micro Systems machines.  These two systems
are very similar in terms of the user interface.  We will be spending some time
learning this interface in the next few days.
