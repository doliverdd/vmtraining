Setting up your environment
</H1>
As noted above one of the advantages to a command line environment is the 
ease with which that environment can be manipulated to make computing tasks
easier.  How the environment is manipulated is determined by 
which shell you are choose.
There are several shells that may be picked to use as your interface such as,
bash, csh, tcsh, ksh, and zsh.  The two most common 
shells are bash and csh. Over
the past several years these shells have started incorporating some of each 
others functionality.  tcsh is a shell that is very similar to csh with much
of the bash functionality.  In this section we will be working exclusively
with bash.  This is not just a matter
of preference, but based on the fact that many pre-existing scripts are written
in bash's predecessor sh.  This means that learning the bash conventions in 
this section will help us in Section <A HREF="node7.html#section:shell_scripts">4.2</A>.
