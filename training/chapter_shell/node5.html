Redirection and piping
</H2>
On Linux systems almost all files, output and even devices are at their most
basic level <I>streams</I>.<A NAME="48"></A> Streams are the way that the OS (or kernel) 
communicate with processes.  The details of this interface are (very far)
beyond the scope of this class, however, you can think of files being read
or written from a program as just a sequential "stream" of bytes.  All of the
input and output commands for files are just methods of controlling this stream.
One interesting aspect of working with streams is
that bash allows you to easily redirect the flow of these streams.  Before
we take a look at how this is done we need a few definitions.
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>pipe</STRONG></DT>
<DD>If you follow a command in Linux with the <code>|</code> character, the output
from that command will be fed into the input of the command that follows the
pipe character.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>standard in or stdin</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is the name given to the input to a program.  
This defaults to the keyboard for most programs.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>standard out or stdout</STRONG></DT>
<DD>By default program output goes to this  
file.  For terminal programs this is usually defined to print back to the 
terminal.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>standard error or stderr</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is a default file for printing errors the 
system produces from a process.  It can be redirected or added to by a program 
or user.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>redirection</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The symbols <code>&gt;,&gt;&gt;,&lt;</code> can be used to redirect a stream to
a file or device.  The most common use is to redirect the output of some 
program to a file.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
Let's look at some examples. The grep command allows you to find the occurrences
of a string in a file.  The simple form is "grep <I>string</I> filename".  The 
command wc prints the byte, word, and line count of a file.  But what if you 
want to know how many lines in a file contain a certain word? Simple,
just run the command "grep <I>string</I> file <code>|</code> wc".  In this command the 
output of grep is used as the input for wc.  (This is a trivial example, 
but adding the full capabilities of grep makes this combination very useful.)

<P>
The <code>&gt;</code>  redirects output to a file, <code>&lt;</code> redirects a file to the standard input of a program, and <code>&gt;&gt;</code> appends the output to the end of
a file.  For example, assume that you have a program proj1 that outputs some
data and you want to capture that data to use as input for program proj2,and you
want to keep a copy on the disk. (Note that "proj1 <code>|</code> proj2" would 
not work since it 
would not store a copy of the output.) One way to accomplish this task would 
be to use the following commands.
<PRE>
frodo@mimir:proj1&gt; output
frodo@mimir:proj2&lt; output
</PRE>
If instead, you want to capture the output of multiple runs of proj1, you 
could replace the <code>&gt;</code> with <code>&gt;&gt;</code> in the first line so that the output 
from proj1 would be appended to the file output.
