Shell Scripts
</H1>
Shell scripts can be a very powerful and useful tool in the Linux environment.
Experienced systems administrators can automate most of their configurations
using this type of programming.  Users will find that many repetitive tasks
are easily transformed into scripts.  Shell script programming has several 
advantages.  For small tasks it is generally quicker than writing 
higher level code and shell scripts can easily call on the power of built-in
functions.  Well written scripts are often trivial to modify, so future tasks 
are not hard to automate. Writing the script can be faster than manually 
performing the task, and once debugged, scripts less error prone than manually
performing the tasks. (That last caveat is very important, remember the 
old adage "To error is human, to really screw things up you need a computer")

<P>
Each shell has its own scripting language.  These are not feature
rich languages, but they have sufficient power for automating many tasks. We
have picked bash for this course  because its syntax is practically the same
as sh which is a shell that is on all Linux systems.  For the rest of this 
section when we refer to shell scripts, we will be specifically referring
to bash shell scripts. 

<P>
We will go over some of the basics of the bash scripting language, and then 
turn our attention to 
some practical examples and exercises. Before you try to run any of the
scripts, you must change the file permissions so that the script is executable.
Setting the script so that your user can read, write, and execute while others
have no access or can just read the script is a good starting place.  How
to do this is left as an exercise for the reader. All of the example scripts
are contained in the code directory. For convenience many of the bash operators
are listed in Appendix <A HREF="#chapter:bashref"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
