What are high-performance libraries?</A>
</H1>

<P>
Almost all scientific programs include a small number of repeating, common
snippets of code which perform certain core, usually simple, mathematical
operations such as multiplying a matrix by a vector.  It is
therefore reasonable to consider these common snippets separately and mix
them into a main program as needed, like, using a culinary metaphor,
when baking a fruit cake.

<P>
Moreover, if you profile a scientific code you will notice that these snippets
are, in fact, where the program spends most of its time.  It is therefore
desirable to have them written very professionally, with precision
and efficiency in mind, and have them tested thoroughly.

<P>
These two requirements are met, at least in principle, by libraries which are
sets of object files that implement specific functions and routines, and which
can be linked with the main object files to produce executables.

<P>
In general, we distinguish between two types of libraries:

<OL>
<LI>Static libraries are linked with the rest of the code when you build
your executable.  In Unix (and Linux) these libraries have extension .a
</LI>
<LI>Dynamic libraries are linked with the ``executable" image at runtime.
In Unix these libraries have extension .so
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
It is important to realize that you need only one copy of a given
library on a machine to which each user has an access but which they should
not be able to modify.  It is usually a bad idea to try to modify a 
``standard library".

<P>
In addition to ``standard" libraries, which are produced (and 
often sold) by reputable organizations and companies, and which are 
not supposed to contain errors, a user can create his/her own libraries.  
Say you are a computational chemist, and your favorite algorithm involves 
some kind of a spatial mesh and you like spherical harmonics.  Chances are, 
most of the codes you will write in your career will include subroutines 
which facilitate integration of spherical harmonics on a spatial mesh of
one kind or another.
You will probably want to include these routines in your library and use
them repeatedly, without having to recompile, provided this library,
too, is error free.  Later we will tell you how to create such a library.

<P>
Before we get to that we want to tell you how to build and use existing
libraries because this is the scenario you will be most often confronted
with.  We will concentrate and practice on one type (arguably the one 
that is most widely used in today's scientific computations) of high 
performance libraries - the linear algebra library.  
After we go through this exercise you may assume that you have a
general knowledge how to build and link to any library you find 
useful in your work.  This, of course, if you stick around through
this entire session.
