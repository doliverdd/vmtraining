<h1>Compiling Basics and Make</h1>

<div class="w3-row">
		  <div class="col-70">
Researchers must often write their own code, or at the very least modify code
that someone else has written.  In the Linux world this means working with
one of the compilers that are available, and more often than not, working
with a makefile (or Makefile).  While we have several different compilers available on our systems we will concentrate
on gcc for this .  Although different compilers have different options,
the basic usage is the same. Concentrating on one compiler will allow us to avoid several complications.  The material should  
easily translate to other compilers, and even other languages.
<p>
Once programs reach a certain complexity, they may require certain libraries,
include files, or may be contained in more than one file.  The command to
compile such a program may consist of several lines.
These problems are further complicated by trying to remember which files where changed and what
are the interdependncies.  Fortunately, in the Linux world we have the command <i> make</i>. 
<br>
With a properly formated <i> makefile</i>, all of these problems are handled automatically.
<p>
<h4>Compiling Basics</h4>

Lets start with a simple example. Let the following program be in the file <br>HiMom.c </b>
<div class="w3-card w3-black" style="width:40%">
main(){<br>
   printf("Hi Mom\n");<br>
}<br>
</div>
To compile this program we could just type <i> gcc HiMom.c</i>.  This would
produce a file called <i> a.out</i>.  While this file would execute correctly,
the next time you compiled a program in this directory you would lose this 
compiled version.  Or worse yet when you came back two days latter would 
you remember what program was compiled into a.out?  It is best to always use
the <i> -o </i>option which lets you name the binary. Compiling the program with
the -o option would look like <i> gcc -o HiMom HiMom.c</i>. This would create the
executable <i> HiMom</i>. 
<p>
Gcc does not print out all of the warnings that it finds compiling the code. 
It will print out warnings if the code is so questionable that it seems as if
the program will not execute correctly.  If you want the code to be portable,
or if you may want to compile with a different compiler it is a good idea to
compile your code with the <i>-Wall</i> flag.  This tells the compiler to 
print all warning messages.  Compiling the HiMom.c code with the command <i>
gcc -Wall -o HiMom HiMom.c</i> produces the following.
<div class="w3-card w3-black" style="width:40%">
$frodo:cc -Wall -o HiMom HiMom.c
$frodo: HiMom.c:1: warning: return type defaults to `int'<br>
$frodo: HiMom.c: In function `main':<br>
$frodo: HiMom.c:2: warning: implicit declaration of function `printf'<br>
$frodo: HiMom.c:3: warning: control reaches end of non-void function<br>
</div>
<p>
None of these warnings will cause problems with this program, but they might
be of concern if they were coming from compilation of a subprogram.  Because 
this is not a class on C programming we won't go into the details of the 
warning messages, but the "fixed" code is given here for completeness.
<div class="w3-card w3-black" style="width:40%">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br>
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;<br>
int main(){<br>
   printf("Hi Mom\n");<br>
   exit(0);<br>
}<br>
</div>
<p>
The characteristics of the executable produced by the compiler may be 
determined by the use of various flags.  There are too many to cover in any
depth in a short introductory class, but we will examine a few of the more
common flags.  There are trade-offs to be made by using different flags.  Be 
aware that the nature of your code will determine if a particular flag will 
be of benefit.  This is a matter of experience and sometimes brute force trial
and error.
<p>
There are two very useful flags <i>-O </i>and <i> -g</i> that you should use on
a regular basis. The -g flag produces extra debugging information that can
be used when running a debugger or program tracer.  This makes larger and 
possibly slower code so it is often used during development and turned off
for production code.  Most compilers can create binaries with different
levels of optimization.  To increase the level of optimization use the -O
flag.  With this flag turned on gcc tries to reduce size and execution time.
There are various levels of optimization, and you should read the man page for
more information.
<p>
So far we have dealt with compiling a single file that only requires the 
standard libraries.  This is not usually the case for research codes.  They
usually need external libraries, and are often contained in multiple files.
Although the topic of libraries will be discussed in the next chapter,
we will give a brief introduction here.  
<p>
Most larger programs have code in several files that are compiled separately,
and then linked into the final code. We will use the following example that
calls a function from another source file.  This is a trivial example that 
we will build on later. 
<p>
File mainProgram.c
<div class="w3-card w3-black" style="width:40%">


/* This program calls a function that returns*/<br>
/* a value.  It is just for demonstration*/ <br>
/* purposes */<br>

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br>
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;<br>
#include "subProgram.h"<br>
int main(){<br>
   double myDouble;<br>
   myDouble=calcValue(5);<br>
   printf("calculated value %10.5f\n",myDouble);<br>
   exit(0);<br>
}<br>
</div>

File subProgram.h
<div class="w3-card w3-black" style="width:40%">
/* a trivial function to use as an example */<br>

double calcValue(int input);<br>
</div>


File subProgram.c
<div class="w3-card w3-black" style="width:40%">

/* Code for a trivial function */<br>

#include "subProgram.h"<br>

double calcValue(int input){<br>

   double returnVal;<br>
   
   returnVal = (input * input) - 3.14;<br>
   
   return(returnVal);<br>
}<br>
</div>

<p>
These files can be compiled with the commands.
<p>

<i>gcc -c -o subProgram.o subProgram.c<br>
gcc -c -o mainProgram.o mainProgram.c<br>
gcc -o myCalculation mainProgram.o subProgram.o<br>
</i>
<p>
On the first two lines the it -c option tells gcc not to run the linker.
Or in other words compile the file and assume that the undefined (but not 
undeclared) functions will be available when the files are linked.
The third command links the .o files and calls the program it myCalculation.
<p>
But what if we want to call a function from a library that is not in our 
standard path. For this example we will use the it gsl or it Gnu Scientific 
Library. These are freely available libraries of various math functions.  They
are not always the fastest, but they are widely available.  Lets assume that
we want to replace our trivial function with a call to the library function that
computes the Bessel Function of order 0.  Then the subProgram.c file becomes:
<p>

/* Code for a trivial function */
<div class="w3-card w3-black" style="width:40%">
#include "subProgram.h"<br>
#include &lt;gsl/gsl_sf_bessel.h&gt; <br>

double calcValue(double input){<br>

   double returnVal;<br>
   returnVal = gsl_sf_bessel_J0 (input);<br>
   
   return(returnVal);<br>
}<br>
</div>
<p>
If we compile it with the same line as above we get the error message, 
"gsl/gsl_sf_bessel.h : No such file or directory".  This is because the gsl include
files are not in one of the standard include paths. (Although in a default 
installation they are put into /usr/local/include.) 
Assume that the gsl libraries are in /opt/gsl/lib and
the includes are in /opt/gsl/include. We can use the <i> -I</i> option
to add this new include directory to the include path for this program. We would
change the line above to "gcc -c -I /opt/gsl/include -o subProgram.o 
subProgram.c" and then the compile will work.  But now when we try to link the
programs with the last gcc line above we get this output.
<p>
<div class="w3-card w3-black" style="width:40%">
subProgram.o(.text+0x1c): In function `calcValue':<br>
: undefined reference to `gsl_sf_bessel_J0'<br>
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status<br>
</div>
<p>
This is because the library file that contains the newline gsl_sf_bessel_J0 function
is not one of the standard library paths.  To get a compile without errors
we must change the last gcc line to be:
<p>

 gcc -L /opt/gsl/lib -lgsl -lgslcblas -o myCalc mainProgram.o subProgram.o

<p>

We have added the <i> -L</i> and the <i> -l</i> flags. The -L flag is to libraries
what the -I flag is to include files.  It says to add the directory, in this
case /opt/gsl/lib, to the paths that are searched for the library files.
the -l flag names library files that are to be used to find functions.  Although we are not only linking the gsl library, but the gslcblas library file. 
This must be done because the gsl library makes calls to the gslcblas libraries.
<h4>Make</h4>
As you can see by now the compiling and linking of large research codes can
begin to get quite complicated.  Imagine that instead of three files in the
last  we had been dealing with one hundred source and header files. 
Added to this problem is that if you change one of the source files it is 
inefficient to have to recompile all of them.  But how can you keep track of 
the dependencies and how can you know when a file was last compiled?  The 
answer on Linux systems is <i>make</i>.  
<i>Make</i> is a program that is designed specifically to handle these problems. Among
other things <i>make</i> can keep track of 
dependencies, and determine when program files need to be recompiled.  The
syntax of a make file is not always clear, but with a little experience it
can be very helpful.  
<p>
Make must know what you want to compile (<i> targets</i>), what other files
the program needs (<i>dependencies</i>), and how you want to compile the
program (<i>commands</i>).
Lets suppose that we have the following rather typical scenario. We want to
make a program <i>myProgram</i>.  The main file is called myProgram.c and it
is dependent on two other source files sub1.c and sub2.c.  The programs
use the math library (-lm) and a library abc which is contained in the /opt/lib
directory.  The include files for abc are in the /opt/include directory.  
Additionally each of the c files has an associated header file, and they
may call functions from each other.  The make file for this may look like:
<p>
<div class="w3-card w3-black" style="width:40%">
# Makefile for myProgram<br>
myProgram: sub1.o sub2.o myProgram.o <br>
   gcc -o myProgram -L/opt/lib -I/opt/include  \<br> 
	  -labc -lm sub1.o sub2.o myProgram.o<br>
<br>
myProgram.o: myProgram.c sub1.h sub2.h<br>
   gcc -c -o myProgram.o -L/opt/lib -I/opt/include \<br>
      -labc -lm myProgram.c<br>

sub1.o: sub1.c sub1.h<br>
   gcc -c -o sub1.o -L/opt/lib -I/opt/include \<br>
      -labc  -lm sub1.c<br>
<br>
sub2.o: sub2.c sub2.h<br>
   gcc -c -o sub2.o -L/opt/lib -I/opt/include \<br>
      -labc -lm sub2.c<br>
<br>
</div>
<p>
Let's look at this file in some detail. The first line is a comment.
The lines that begin with a program 
name and a colon followed by a list of files is a target-dependency line.
What goes before the colon is the <i> target</i> and the other files are the
<i>dependencies</i>.  Make will keep track of which of these files have
changed since the target was last compiled, and will recompile them before 
compiling the target. It will not recompile a target if none of the dependencies
have changed.  Notice the  \ at the end of the first gcc line.  This is
the continuation character for make so these two lines are treated as one. 
Extra white space is deleted when a continuation character is used.  This 
leads to one of the most frustrating aspects of the makefile for new users.
The gcc lines must begin with a <b>tab</b> or make has a problem.  By default, make
compiles the first target.  If you want to compile one of the other targets
you can (for example) just type make sub1.o and only that target and it's 
dependencies (if necessary) will be compiled.
<p>
Make allows assigning values to variables.  This can clean up the lines of 
a make file.  We've done this in the second version of the make file for
myProgram.
<div class="w3-card w3-black" style="width:40%">
# Makefile for myProgram<br>
LIBS = -L /opt/lib -labc -lm<br>
INCLUDES = -I /opt/include<br>
OBJECTS = sub1.o sub2.o myProgram.o<br>
myProgram: $(OBJECTS) <br>
   gcc -o myProgram $(INCLUDES) $(LIBS) $(OBJECTS)<br>  
	  <br>
<br>
myProgram.o: myProgram.c sub1.h sub2.h<br>
   gcc -c -o myProgram.o $(LIBS) $(INCLUDES)\<br>
      myProgram.c<br>
<br>
sub1.o: sub1.c sub1.h<br>
   gcc -c -o sub1.o $(INCLUDES) $(LIBS) sub1.c<br>
<br>
sub2.o: sub2.c sub2.h<br>
   gcc -c -o sub2.o $(INCLUDES) $(LIBS) sub2.c<br>
<br>
clean:<br>
   /bin/rm *.o<br>
</div>
<p>
In this version we assign the library directories, include directories, and
object files to variables, which are then used in the dependencies and 
command lines.  This not only makes the file more readable, it also helps 
when adding or removing files from the project. We've also added a dummy target
clean.  This is a common practice.  In this case we've removed all of the 
.o files.  This feature makes it easier to move projects between systems and
to handle changes in the library files.  In effect what it does is remove all
of the .o files so that the next run will recompile everything. This dummy
target adds significant flexibility to make.
<p>
<h4>Exercises</h4>
<ol class="w3-ol">
<li>Add a loop to the main program file in the example that calculates the
Bessel function to call the sub-program a large number of times.  Experiment
with the size of the loop so that the executions takes some significant amount
of time. (Say  &gt; 3 minutes) Use the Linux "time" command to time your 
runs.(Check the man page.)</li> 
<li>Now try compiling the program with different levels of
optimization to see if the code gets faster.</li>
<li>Create a makefile so that the code from the Bessel function example can
be compiled with make.  </li>
<li>Extend the file so that if you want to compile with
the -g option you make one target, and if you want to compile without the
-g option you make another target. </li>
</ol>
<h4>Advanced Exercise</h4>
Look up the the it -D option for gcc and see
if you can use this to compile the program with the Bessel option sometimes
and with some other function of your choice at other times.  (Even just square
root as an example) Put these changes into the makefile so that you can
make the version that you want with no changes to the code or makefile.
