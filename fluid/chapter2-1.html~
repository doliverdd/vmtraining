It is not necessary to become a Linux guru to be able to effectively
use these systems.  In fact, most of your interaction with the system will be 
through what is called a shell.  A shell is nothing more than a program
that makes using the system resources easier.  Those of you that
have used the "Command Tool" in Windows operating systems have used a shell 
which is referred to as the DOS shell.  Although it may
seem awkward at first for those of you that have only used a GUI based system
like Windows, it will quickly become second nature.  Many people, after 
becoming comfortable with the command line, find a GUI interface 
somewhat restrictive.  This interface to the system resources is called a
command line interface.

<br>
The default user shell for Linix is called bash.
In this part of the training, you will find out how to access the system, use 
the command line interface and the shell, work with file and 
directories, and learn some basic commands.
