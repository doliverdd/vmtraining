		<h3>What is High Performance Computing?</h3>
	
	  High Performance computing is an often poorly defined concept.
		There are several terms that are often confused with High Performance Computing,
		such as; High Throughput Computing, Parallel Computing, Numerically 
		Intensive Computing, Grid Computing, etc. In fact all of these are facets of 
		High Performance Computing.  For our purposes we will define High Performance
		Computing to consist of hardware and software resources used for computational
		science that are beyond what is commonly found on the desktop machine.
