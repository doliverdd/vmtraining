<h4>Getting Started</h4>
The first thing that you must know is how to access the system.  You should have
been given an account name and password when you arrived in the lab today.  
You will need both to access the system since Linux is a true multiuser system.
Please keep the account name and password in a safe place.  
For our examples we will assume that the system has
a user with the account name <i>frodo</i>. Notice that frodo is not capitalized. 
This is because Linux is case sensitive. Before we log on to the system 
let's take a look at the filesystem structure.  
<br>
The filesystem on Linux is composed of 
directories and files.  The directories are synonymous with 
folders in the Windows operating systems.  The main system directories
are displayed below. On most Linux systems the contents
of these main directories are fairly standard, although the reasons may not be
clear. The common contents of some of the more important directories for users
are listed here:


	
	<p>
	<table>
		<tr><th>Directory</th><th>Contents</th>
		<tr>
			<td>/bin</td>
			<td>Command binaries </td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>/home </td>
			<td>Users home directories</td>

			<td> System libraries</td>

		<tr>
			<td>/sbin </td>
			<td> System binaries</td>

			<td>/tmp </td>
			<td> Scratch Space </td>

		<tr>
			<td> /usr/bin</td>
			<td>Binaries for user commands </td>

		<tr>
			<td>/usr/include </td>
			<td> Header or include files</td>

			<td>Libraries  </td>
